Use WASD keys to move around, use space key to shoot normal straight bullets and use B key to fire homing missiles.
Almost all of the assets in gmae are hand made (don't judge the music). Kill a certain number of mob enemies to reach the boss stage.
Boss enemy has 4 different turrets that you need to destroy before you can deal damage to the boss. The turrets all behave differently (polymorphism).
There is some code in the project for SAVE/LOAD state functionality but its not complete as of yet
